### A Lifelong Multilingual Multi-granularity Semantic Alignment Approach via Maximum Co-occurrence Probability

#### Description
This repository includes the source used in the paper "A Lifelong Multilingual Multi-granularity Semantic Alignment Approach via Maximum Co-occurrence Probability" of COLING 2024. 
Basically, the program proposes a lifelong multilingual multi-granularity semantic alignment approach, which continuously extracts massive aligned linguistic units from noisy data via a maximum co-occurrence probability algorithm. 
More details about the underneath model can be found in the submitted paper.
